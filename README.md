# Enhancing Graph Database Interaction Through Generative AI-Driven Natural Language Interface for Financial-Fraud Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a financial fraud detection system integrating **Graph Databases (Neo4j)** with **Generative AI models** such as **LLaMA-2**, **T5**, **BERT**, and **GPT-4**, enabling a **Natural Language Interface** for interacting with graph-based transaction data.

## üß† Project Overview

Traditional financial fraud detection systems struggle with complex, relational data and user interaction. This project addresses these challenges by:

- Using **Neo4j Graph Database** to represent relationships between accounts and transactions.
- Enabling **Natural Language Querying** powered by generative AI models (LLaMA-2, T5, GPT-4).
- Combining **rule-based filtering** and **AI-based classification** for fraud detection.
- Visualizing graph results interactively using **Pyvis**.
